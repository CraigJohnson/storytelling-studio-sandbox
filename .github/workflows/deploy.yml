# Storytelling Studio Apps deploy action
#
# S2 apps use Google docs and sheets to supply the data they consume. Updating that data
# has meant getting a developer to run a package.json script to save the data to the repo, 
# then either run a bash script to deploy the changes to the CDN or go through normal GitHub 
# pull request workflow to trigger an automated deployment.
#
# There is a want to cut the developer out of the process so that an editor can updata data
# in the Google doc, then select an action from the "Adds-ons" menu to trigger a deployment 
# directly. This action, combined with an add-on script, does just that.
